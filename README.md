# M110-Ideal-Workplace

This is a Unity project for the M110. It's purpose is to be a simple 3D game based on my ideal working environment.

For this week's project. I created a sample scene with a camera, a not-yet playable character and some background music.
This is a prototype that encapsulates the essence of the workplace I am trying to create. Also, along with some redesigning and cleaning up will probably be in the final game. The name of the scene is SampleScene in Assets/Scenes. I did not use the standard template provided. but instead I have used many free external packets from the asset store. In case there are compatibility or performance issues let me know and I will try to fix them on upcoming updates.

Kind Regards,
Krikor
